#### Steve
Thank... Thank you.
Thanks very much.
And I know that there's a lot of people
on the list to play tonight,but I was wondering if I could just add one more.
She's a friend of mine who,like me, is a long way from home.
And if it's OK with you,
I was wondering if you'd like her to come up here and
play one of her songs.
Is that OK? Yeah?
Gretta, would you come up here, please?

Uh, just give me a moment.
I think it would be a good idea if you'd come up and sing one of your songs.
It would be a really fucking bad idea.
Oh, Gretta, come on,
this is New York.

#### Gretta
- No.

#### Steve
- You want to hear it, right?
Yeah?

#### Gretta
- Yeah?

#### Steve
- Yes!

Sing it!
You're gonna be amazing.

#### Gretta
Um, hi.
Uh, so this is a new song,
so it might be kind of rough.
Um... It's for anyone who's ever been alone in the city.
Thanks.

- Oh, I certainly did.

#### MC
Did you hear about that, Katie?
Fresh prospects, let's hear it.
What do you got for me?

#### Dane
No, no!
Who's next on this delightful journey?
No, no, no, no, man.
No!
No, you can't...
No, you can't!t's shit. It's shit!

Get fucking out of my car.
Give me anything, a song, a hook, anything I can work with.
I'm not asking for much.

That's something.
That's good.
Until you started to sing.
Fuck.
Shit.

#### Violet
Where's Mom?

#### Dane
Where's my daughter?

#### Violet
What do you mean?

#### Dane
Your mom has a deadline.
She asked me to watch you today.
Let's go.

So where do you want to go,the Museum of Natural History?
You want to go to the park
and get ice cream or what?
Why would I want to do that?
I'm not ten.
What's that smell?
Oh, that's gasoline. I was filling up
the car with gasoline,
and then I spilled
a little on my pant leg.
That isn't alcohol.
I think I got a meeting here.
You want to wait here
or you want to come?
You think you have a meeting?
